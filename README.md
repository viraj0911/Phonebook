# Phonebook

A simple but efficient phonebook directory made by implementing functions like search and update by using doubly linked lists.

## Description

The project revolves around a phonebook directory that is created by using the primary concepts of linked lists. We have implemented a user account to just identify the user. Main functions implemented in the code are inserting , deleting and updating a number name and email of a particular contact. Other functions also include searching a contact by name ,number and email address. In addition we have also included the option to delete the entries with the same name, number and email.
